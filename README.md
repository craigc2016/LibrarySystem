# LibrarySystem
The repository contains a software project developed in second year of my degree. It is developed in Java using the java swing and awt libraries.
It uses jdbc jar file to allow for an SQL backend implementation. The system allows for user accounts to be register which allows the user
to login in. The system has a sql table that has books which can be rented. It also has an admin account system allowing for crud features
on all the tables.
